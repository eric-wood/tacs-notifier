## TACS Meeting Notifier

This is a little pet project aimed at making the lives of the Texas A&M Computing Society's leadership easier.

Here's the basic idea: TACS has several social media accounts for updating members about upcoming meetings. It's a pain to update them all each week. This project aims to update all of these accounts based on the Google calendar. Whoever is in charge of scheduling just has to keep the calendar up to date and this would take care of the rest. 

### Installation

This is all in Ruby! Wonderful!

First of all, make sure Ruby is installed. I'll wait.

Now, do this inside the project's root directory:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

That'll make sure all the gems we need are installed.
